Android Studio project for Androzic
===================================

There is one dependency that is not present in this repository: you should manually fetch color-picker-view library from https://code.google.com/p/color-picker-view/

To get all stuff at once issue:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/foo/bar.git
    cd bar

For already cloned repo, just use:

   git clone git://github.com/foo/bar.git
   cd bar
   git submodule update --init --recursive
